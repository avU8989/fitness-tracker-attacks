# Fitness-Tracker Attack Testbed
Research testbed for analyzing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fitness-tracker vulnerabilities. Includes a React Native app with BLE integration, a Node/Express API, and tooling to simulate devices and run replay/spoof scenarios. Results support a NIST-aligned risk assessment and a hardened reference architecture. For educational use in controlled labs only.
